# Example Audio Plugin CMakeLists.txt

# To get started on a new plugin, copy this entire folder (containing this file and C++ sources) to
# a convenient location, and then start making modifications.

# The first line of any CMake project should be a call to `cmake_minimum_required`, which checks
# that the installed CMake will be able to understand the following CMakeLists, and ensures that
# CMake's behaviour is compatible with the named version. This is a standard CMake command, so more
# information can be found in the CMake docs.

# The top-level CMakeLists.txt file for a project must contain a literal, direct call to the

# `juce_add_plugin` adds a static library target with the name passed as the first argument
# (AudioPluginExample here). This target is a normal CMake target, but has a lot of extra properties set
# up by default. As well as this shared code static library, this function adds targets for each of
# the formats specified by the FORMATS arguments. This function accepts many optional arguments.
# Check the readme at `docs/CMake API.md` in the JUCE repo for the full list.

# `juce_generate_juce_header` will create a JuceHeader.h for a given target, which will be generated
# into your build tree. This should be included with `#include <JuceHeader.h>`. The include path for

# include all your JUCE module headers; if you're happy to include module headers directly, you
# probably don't need to call this.

# `target_compile_definitions` adds some preprocessor definitions to our target. In a Projucer

# need that's not on by default, check the module header for the correct flag to set here. These
# definitions will be visible both to your code, and also the JUCE module code, so for new
# definitions, pick unique names that are unlikely to collide! This is a standard CMake command.
