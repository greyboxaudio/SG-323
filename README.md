 Ursa Major Stargate 323

// This personal project is in no way affilliated or associated with Ursa Major Inc / Christopher Moore / Seven Woods Audio Inc / AKG

This plugin is an authentic emulation of my Ursa Major Stargate 323 Reverb. It is based on over 2 years of work, which included a detailed analysis of the original circuit logic and filters, as well as the actual eprom data.
